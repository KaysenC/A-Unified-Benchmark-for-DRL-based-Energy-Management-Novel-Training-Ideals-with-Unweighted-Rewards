# A-Unified-Benchmark-for-DRL-based-Energy-Management-Novel-Training-Ideals-with-Unweighted-Rewards

Reinforcement learning (RL) stands as the powerful force in the realm of intelligent control for hybrid power systems. However, certain flaws hinder the positive advancement of learning-based strategies and essential solutions should be proposed to address these challenges. First of all, to solve the lack of unified benchmark models and results in the field of energy management strategies (EMS) for hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), two Python-based standard deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents, deep q-network and deep deterministic policy gradient, and four Simulink-based public hybrid powertrains, P1-P4 released by MathWorks, are employed, forming the co-simulation training structure as the reliable solution. Secondly, the defects of traditional reward functions in previous studies are revealed, such as misleading training and confusing adjustment of weights, and then this paper proposes novel training ideas, combining the rule-based engine start-stop and the unweighted reward function dedicated to the efficiency optimization of an engine. Finally, treating the P2 configuration as a target, the hardware-in-the-loop test is conducted. The results show that while online testing on a real controller, the DRL-based EMSs get a fuel economy of 6.537L/100km and 6.330L/100km, respectively, and the final results indicate that more efficient and reasonable engine control. Most of the results, standard DRL algorithms, and reliable hybrid powertrains have been published on GitHub, which forms public, reliable, and reproducible benchmarks for subsequent research.
