# A-Unified-Benchmark-for-DRL-based-Energy-Management-Novel-Training-Ideals-with-Unweighted-Rewards

Python-based standard DRL agents, the DQN for discrete con-trol tasks and the DDPG for continuous control tasks, and Simulink-based public hybrid system models, four powertrains of P1-P4 equipped with one motor released by MathWorks on https://ww2.mathworks.cn/help/releases/R2020a/autoblks/ug/hybrid-and-electric-vehicle-reference-application-projects.html, are employed. Through building a Py-thon/Simulink-based co-simulation framework, a series of reliable results are achieved, including the official EMS (rule and ECMS) and two learning-based EMSs. The above content serves as a unified benchmark for subsequent research, and the standard DRL model used has also been made public https://github.com/KaysenC/A-Unified-Benchmark-for-DRL-based-Energy-Management-Novel-Training-Ideals-with-Unweighted-Rewards. As long as related co-simulation settings are completed, this is public, reliable, and reproducible on any computing device installed with the Powertrain Blockset on Matlab/Simulink.
